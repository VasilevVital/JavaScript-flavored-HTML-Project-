#JavaScript Project 

This project will serve as a review for all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we've learned so far in class.

Before you do anything, you should break into groups of 3 or 4. You'll be working together for the next 2-3 classes. 

##Rules

> ## What you're making: 
> 1. You'll create a single webpage. This could be a blog like Tumblr, a social media landing page, a photo sharing site (like Instagram or Pinterest)
> 2. This obviously means you'll need to create an .html, a .css file, and at least one .js file. 
> 3. You can include your css and JavaScript inside the html file, but you can also create seperate files and link to them in the html file. 
> 
> ## Basic requirements: 
> 1. Before you write any code, you'll need to brainstorm with your team and make a simple wireframe. Once you're done, go to your assigned instructor who will make sure your idea satisfies the project requirements. Be prepared to explain how your proposed wireframe meets the requirements and how you'll approach making the page and what tools you'll use. 
> 2. You must include at least three of the following JavaScript tasks:   
> ####JavaScript
>   + Include a `<button>` element that, when clicked, causes something to change on the page. For example, an image can disappear, or appear, or text might change color, etc. 
>   + Use an array of data to create a list of something in your HTML. For example, if you have an array like this, you would have to somehow turn it into html: `var posts = [['John','image1.jpg',34],['Sammy','face.jpg',90],['Shera','vacation1.jpg',103]]`. So posts[i][0] is the poster's name, posts[i][1] is the image url and posts[i][2] is the number of likes. You need to come up with your own data. 
>   + Include a way for the user to type text into an `<input>` element (i.e. textbox), and then when the user clicks a button, the text is appended onto the html. 
>   + In the above task, check if the input is valid. You see this a lot when you have to make a password when signing up for some new site. For example, you might want to make sure whatever the user is typing and submitting is at least 8 characters long and starts with a letter 'a'. You can make up your own requirements. 
>   + If your team decides to work with an array, you might want to allow users to add new 'posts' by typing and submitting from your input box. How do you add new items to your array?
